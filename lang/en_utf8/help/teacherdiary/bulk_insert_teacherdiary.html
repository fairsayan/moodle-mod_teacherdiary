<div class="indent">
<p>You can create many teacher diaries together uploading a CSV file.
The first row must contain the names of all the fields, in this table you have the meaning of each field:</p>
<table cellpadding="5" border="1" style="width: 80%; margin: auto">
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>teacher</td>
    <td>Username of the teacher who will be the owner of the diary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>course</td>
    <td>ID course number</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>section</td>
    <td>The number of the section in which must be inserted the diary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>Name of the diary</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>plannedhours</td>
    <td>Planned hours for this diary</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If already exists another diary with the same name in a course, the new diary won't be created.<br />
